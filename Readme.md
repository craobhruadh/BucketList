# BucketList

A python tool for cataloging bucket list items, things you want to write down so that you don't forget

# Note on code style

This repo has the following pre-commit hooks: `black`, `isort`, and `flake8`.  It assumes you have these all installed.  Call them each one at a time, and make sure you have fixed everything flake8 tells you to do, before committing.

Tests should run and pass if you call `pytest` in the base directory
